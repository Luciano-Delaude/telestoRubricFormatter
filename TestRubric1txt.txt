County Parks & Recreation + Chamber of Commerce Partnership Presentation — Grading Rubric (0.0–100.0)

What is being graded
A concise PowerPoint presentation intended for a County Recreation Advisory Board to persuade them that the County Parks & Recreation department should pursue a first community partnership with the local Chamber of Commerce.

The task requires (at minimum):
1) An overview of why the department should pursue community partnerships
2) What Chambers of Commerce generally do
3) Reasons a Chamber would make a strong first partner
4) Potential direct and indirect benefits of the partnership
5) A concise deck of 8–10 slides (inclusive)
6) Slide-by-slide discussion is encouraged (the deck should invite discussion on each slide)

Score reporting (important)
- Report the final score as a 0–100 value (example: “96/100”), not as a 0–1 normalized value.
- If you need a normalized score for a separate system, compute it as (final_score / 100), but still report X/100.

How to score
- Points = A + B + C + D + E + F (maximum 100.0).
- Then subtract penalties N1–N7 that are clearly triggered (maximum total deductions across all penalties = 50).
- Final score = max(0.0, points − penalties).

Preamble rules for consistent grading
1) Visibility/legibility gate (applies to B–E)
- Only content that is visible and readable in slideshow view counts for scoring in sections B–E.
- If key text is truncated, hidden, off-slide, or unreadably small/low-contrast, treat that content as “not included” for B–E (even if it exists in the file’s underlying text).

2) Non-overlap rule (avoid double-penalizing)
- A1 is file-open/format only (do not judge layout/legibility in A1).
- Readability/layout issues are scored in F.
- If overlap/clipping hides required content: reduce credit in B–E (visibility gate) AND score the layout failure in F2. Do not additionally penalize beyond that, except N6 if the deck is truly meeting-unusable.

3) Submission hygiene (N7) grader procedure (to avoid false positives)
- Before generating any grader-created artifacts (renders/screenshots), record/list the contents of the designated submission area.
- Render slides to a grader-controlled temporary location (not the submission area).
- Apply N7 only for artifacts that were present prior to grading or that the submitter explicitly states they created.
- Saving the final PPTX in the designated submission folder is allowed and is not, by itself, a hygiene violation.

Recommended inspection method (practical)
- Open the PowerPoint in slideshow mode and/or render all slides to images.
- Count slides.
- Verify required content is present and readable.
- Verify discussion invitations on content slides (A3).
- Check readability/layout (F).
- Apply penalties only when clearly triggered.

A) Deliverable format & structure (20 points)

A1 (10) Valid PowerPoint file provided; opens
- 10: A .pptx (or .ppt) is provided and opens successfully in a standard tool.
- 5: Opens only after repair/recovery prompts but remains viewable/editable.
- 0: No PowerPoint provided (e.g., outline only, link only), wrong format only, or file does not open.

A2 (4) Slide count meets the “8–10 slides” requirement
- 4: 8–10 slides inclusive.
- 2: 7 or 11 slides.
- 0: ≤6 or ≥12 slides.

A3 (5) Discussion invitation on every content slide (title slide optional; must be visible/readable)
Definitions:
- “Title slide” = the first slide if it clearly functions as a cover/title (e.g., title/purpose only). If there is no clear title slide, treat all slides as content slides.
- “Discussion invitation” = either:
  a) a visible on-slide prompt/callout/question (e.g., “Discussion question: …”, “Board prompt: …”, “Consider: …”), OR
  b) at least one bullet on that slide is phrased as a question (ends with “?”).
Visibility requirement:
- Tiny, faint, or otherwise unreadable prompts do not count.
Scoring (monotonic: adding visible prompts cannot reduce the score):
- 5: 100% of content slides have a visible, readable discussion invitation.
- 3: At least 80% of content slides have a visible, readable discussion invitation.
- 2: 100% of content slides have discussion invitations, but some/all are in speaker notes only (not visible on-slide).
- 1: Discussion invitations appear on some slides (visible and/or notes) but coverage is <80% of content slides.
- 0: No meaningful discussion invitations.

A4 (1) Skimmable slide structure (not a font/layout check)
- 1: Slides are primarily bullets/short phrases (discussion-friendly); no paragraph blocks that prevent slide-by-slide discussion.
- 0: Multiple slides are dense narrative paragraphs or otherwise unskimmable.

B) Core content coverage required by the task (40 points) — apply visibility/legibility gate

B1 (10) Why Parks & Rec should pursue community partnerships (department-specific rationale)
Full credit requires at least 3 distinct, Parks & Rec–relevant reasons (not just generic “partnerships are good”).
- 10: 3+ clear, department-relevant reasons.
- 7: 2–3 reasons, somewhat department-relevant but partially generic.
- 4: 1–2 reasons and/or mostly generic.
- 1: Very vague mention without real rationale.
- 0: Missing (or unreadable per visibility gate).

B2 (10) What Chambers of Commerce generally do (accurate, neutral overview)
Full credit requires an accurate and neutral description (no political endorsements; avoid overclaiming).
- 10: Accurate overview with 3+ typical functions (e.g., convening/networking, promotion/communications, community initiatives/member services; advocacy may be mentioned neutrally).
- 7: Mostly accurate but missing important typical functions or includes mild overstatement.
- 4: Vague or partially inaccurate.
- 1: Major inaccuracies that could mislead the Board.
- 0: Missing (or unreadable).

B3 (10) Why the Chamber is a strong first partner (plausible, locally relevant, risk-aware)
Full credit requires at least 3 plausible reasons and a clear “why this is a good first partner” argument that fits a skeptical board (without overpromising).
- 10: 3+ plausible, locally relevant reasons + risk-aware framing (e.g., prudent first step, low complexity, clear value proposition).
- 7: 2–3 reasons; some risk awareness, but weaker “why first” logic or slightly overstated claims.
- 4: 1–2 reasons; largely generic or not tailored to skepticism.
- 1: Very weak/unsupported justification.
- 0: Missing (or unreadable).

B4 (5) Potential direct benefits to Parks & Rec (department-level; concrete)
- 5: At least 3 concrete direct benefits.
- 3: 2 direct benefits and/or benefits are somewhat vague.
- 1: 1 direct benefit only, vague.
- 0: Missing (or unreadable).

B5 (5) Potential indirect benefits to the County/community (concrete)
- 5: At least 2 plausible indirect benefits.
- 3: 1 indirect benefit (or 2 but very vague).
- 0: Missing (or unreadable).

C) Persuasion for a skeptical board & basic risk-handling (16 points) — apply visibility/legibility gate
Note: This section rewards practical reassurance appropriate to a skeptical public-sector advisory board. It is intentionally “basic” and should not require a fully developed legal/procurement framework. Do not double-count the same safeguard across items where the rubric says not to.

C1 (5) Acknowledges skepticism and proposes a credible low-risk way to try
- 5: Explicitly recognizes partnership concerns and proposes a credible low-risk approach (e.g., pilot/phased start, guardrails, oversight/evaluation before expansion).
- 3: Skepticism/risk acknowledged but mitigation approach is vague or incomplete.
- 1: Only implicit risk awareness with little mitigation.
- 0: No acknowledgment of skepticism or no mitigation approach.

C2 (3) Mission drift/commercialization limits + preserving public control (WHAT this prevents)
Definition (counts for C2):
- Limits on commercialization/branding and safeguards that preserve County control of public programs.
Examples that DO count for C2:
- Recognition-only acknowledgments, signage/branding limits, no naming rights, County retains control over programming/pricing/eligibility.
Examples that do NOT count for C2 (they belong in C3b instead):
- “Pre-approval workflow” for messaging, designated spokesperson/PIO, complaint/escalation process.
Scoring:
- 3: At least 2 concrete C2 safeguards are stated.
- 2: Exactly 1 concrete C2 safeguard.
- 1: Vague “mission first / public control” statement without a mechanism.
- 0: Missing.

C3a (2) Explicit nonpartisan/programmatic-only statement
- 2: Clearly states no political advocacy/endorsements as part of the partnership (or equivalent explicit neutrality statement).
- 1: Implied neutrality but not explicit.
- 0: Missing or contradictory.

C3b (1) Communications process controls (HOW messaging is controlled) — do not double-count C2 items here
Definition (counts for C3b):
- Process/mechanism controls for communications and branding approvals.
Examples that DO count for C3b:
- Pre-approval workflow for messaging/branding, designated spokesperson/PIO, formal complaint/escalation path, logo use approval process.
Examples that do NOT count for C3b:
- Recognition-only rules, signage limits, no naming rights (these are C2).
Non-overlap note:
- If a safeguard fits C2, do not count it again under C3b.
Scoring:
- 1: At least one C3b control is included.
- 0: Missing.

C4 (3) Procurement/ethics/fairness (modest weight; partial credit for general language)
- 3: Includes 2+ concrete fairness/ethics safeguards (e.g., open opportunity/open call or similar fairness mechanism, no quid pro quo, transparency, conflict-of-interest handling, donations/sponsorship processed under public policy).
- 2: Includes 1 concrete safeguard beyond “we’ll follow rules.”
- 1: Only generic “we will follow County rules/policies.”
- 0: Missing OR implies pay-to-play, exclusivity, or preferential treatment.

C5a (1) Workload realism (clarified scoring: bounded scope OR staffing/time acknowledgment earns credit)
Award credit if EITHER is present (readable on-slide):
- Bounded scope examples: time-limited pilot (e.g., “3–6 months” or “one season”), cap on number of events/activities, limited deliverables, phased rollout.
OR
- Explicit staffing/time acknowledgment examples: named liaison/point of contact, defined staff-hour cap, realistic statement about staff capacity/roles.
Scoring:
- 1: At least one qualifying bounded-scope or staffing/time realism statement is present.
- 0: Missing.

C5b (1) Volunteer/participant safety & liability mention
- 1: Mentions at least one safety/liability control (e.g., waivers, safety briefings, supervision, background checks where youth are involved, insurance/standard procedures).
- 0: Missing.

D) Success metrics & evaluation (6 points) — apply visibility/legibility gate
Clarification (metrics): Credit is for clear, measurable indicators (what will be tracked), not numeric targets. Placeholders for numbers are acceptable if the indicators themselves are concrete and measurable.

D1 (4) Measurable indicators (what will be tracked)
Categories (examples): participation/reach; quality/safety; equity/access; resources (staff time, in-kind, cost avoidance).
- 4: Indicators cover 3–4 categories.
- 2: Indicators cover exactly 2 categories.
- 1: Indicators cover exactly 1 category.
- 0: No measurable indicators.

D2 (2) Report-back plan to the Advisory Board
- 2: Clear plan to report results to the Board (e.g., written results plus a go/adjust/no-go recommendation).
- 1: Mentions evaluation but unclear how/when Board is informed.
- 0: Missing.

E) Decision & next steps (6 points) — apply visibility/legibility gate

E1 (3) Explicit authorization/decision ask to the Board
- 3: Clear “what we are asking you to approve/support” statement.
- 1: Ask is implied but not explicit.
- 0: Missing.

E2 (3) Concrete next steps and/or near-term timeline
- 3: 2+ concrete next steps and/or a near-term timeline.
- 2: 1 concrete next step plus general next steps.
- 1: Vague next steps only.
- 0: Missing.

F) Readability & professional usability (12 points; visual checks ≤20% of total)
Score using slideshow view or rendered images.

F1 (6) Legibility at meeting distance
- 6: Comfortable to read; good contrast; not overly dense.
- 4: Mostly readable; a few crowded or borderline slides.
- 2: Many slides hard to read (small text, low contrast, or excessive density).
- 0: Largely unreadable.

F2 (4) Layout integrity (clipping/overlap/overflow/alignment)
Threshold guide:
- Minor issues on 1–2 slides = 2–3 points
- Issues on 3–4 slides OR repeated overlaps that hide content = 1 point
- Widespread issues (>50% of slides) = 0 points
Scoring:
- 4: No meaningful clipping/overlap/truncation; no overflow outside intended containers; consistent margins/alignment.
- 2–3: Minor layout problems on 1–2 slides; comprehension intact.
- 1: Layout problems on 3–4 slides or repeated hiding of content.
- 0: Widespread layout failures.

F3 (1) Plain language; acronyms defined on first use
- 1: Plain-language suitable for a mixed board audience; acronyms are defined on first use.
- 0: Frequent jargon/undefined acronyms hinder comprehension.

F4 (1) No obvious placeholder/template text left in final deck
- 1: No visible placeholders (e.g., “Insert title,” “Month YYYY,” “Click to add text”).
- 0: Placeholder/template text remains visible.

Negative penalties (deduct after A–F; max total deductions = 50)
Apply only when clearly triggered. Do not double-penalize the same readability/layout issue already captured by F, except N6 for extreme meeting-unusable decks.

N1 (-30) No functioning PowerPoint delivered
Triggers: file missing, link-only submission (e.g., a web link without PPTX), wrong format only, or the PowerPoint cannot be opened.

N2 (-3) Slide count far outside requested range
Trigger: ≤5 slides OR ≥13 slides.
(Note: This is intentionally additional to A2 for extreme noncompliance.)

N3 (-4) Political advocacy/endorsements or partisan messaging
Triggers: endorsing/opposing candidates/parties/ballot measures; urging lobbying/partisan action; partisan slogans.

N4 (-4) Quid pro quo / exclusivity / preferential treatment implied
Triggers: pay-to-play, exclusive access, “members only” participation, or sponsorship implying decision influence or preferential treatment.

N5 (-4) Privacy/IT safety violation
Triggers: proposes sharing participant personally identifiable information (PII) with partner without protection; proposes partner access to internal County systems/accounts/data beyond public-facing materials.

N6 (-3) Severe multi-slide legibility failure (meeting-unusable)
Apply only in extreme cases (in addition to F), such as:
- >50% of slides unreadable/clipped in a way that prevents use in a meeting, OR
- Consistently tiny text across many slides (appears ~≤18pt equivalent), OR
- Extremely low contrast across many slides.

N7 (-2) Submission hygiene: prohibited intermediate outputs (tightened to avoid false positives)
Trigger only if submitter-created non-deliverable artifacts:
- Are bundled alongside the final deliverable in the designated submission area, OR
- Are placed in any location(s) the assignment explicitly prohibits for intermediate outputs.
Do NOT penalize:
- The final PPTX being saved in the designated submission folder (allowed).
- Grader-generated temporary files created during inspection (e.g., slide renders produced by the grader).
Required grader procedure for applying N7:
- Perform a pre-check by listing the designated submission area contents before creating any grader artifacts.
- Render/inspect using a grader-controlled temp location (not the submission area).
- Penalize only artifacts present prior to grading or those the submitter explicitly claims to have created.

Edge-case guidance (for unambiguous scoring)
- Case A: 9 slides; no explicit “Discussion prompt” line, but each content slide includes a question-form bullet → A3 can be full credit (5).
- Case B: Web link only, no PPTX file → A1 = 0 and apply N1 (-30). If a PPTX export is provided and opens, grade normally.
- Case C: Procurement/ethics language is only “we’ll follow County rules” → C4 should receive partial credit (1), not full.
- Case D: 6–7 bullets per slide but still legible → A4 can still be 1 if skimmable; F1/F2 can be full if genuinely readable and well-laid-out.
- N7 application reminder: Do the pre-check and render to temp; do not penalize files created by the grader during inspection.
